### summary 
Youâ€™re given a program:
```bash
/challenge/challenge
```
But if you just run it like this:
```bash
/challenge/challenge
```
â€¦**it wonâ€™t give you the flag**.

So what do you do?

ðŸ‘‰ You **read the documentation** â€” and the docs say:

To properly run this program, you will need to pass it the argument of `--giveflag`.

That means the program is expecting you to give it a special command-line option: `--giveflag`.

### solution 
- Run:
```bash
/challenge/challenge --giveflag
```
