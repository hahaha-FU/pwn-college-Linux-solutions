### summary 
You still need to find out how to use:
```bash
/challenge/challenge
```
‚Ä¶to get the flag.

But this time, its **manual (man page)** has been **renamed** randomly ‚Äî so you can‚Äôt just run:
```bash
man /challenge/challenge
```
Instead, you need to **search the entire man page database** to find anything that might be related.

**`man man`**
This means:

  Read the manual for the man command itself to learn how to use its advanced features.
So run:
```bash
man man
```
- Now scroll or search using `/` for the word search.
- You‚Äôll find a section about `-k` and `-K` options.

üìö **What you'll learn from man man**:
- `man -k something` ‚Üí Search for something **by name/description**
- `man -K something` ‚Üí Search for something **inside the full text of all man page**
__________
### solution
- Use man `-k` challenge
*This searches all man page names/descriptions for anything with ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù:*
```bash
man -k challenge
```
- Use the power move: `man -K`
*This searches the full text of all man pages for a specific word (slower but more powerful)*:
```bash
man -K /challenge/challenge
```
 *This will scan every man page and show you which one mentions <br>
 `/challenge/challenge`. That's the one you want*!
-  Open the result
  *When you find the matching page (example: `abc123(7)`), open it like this*:
```bash
man 7 abc123
```
*Then, read the manual to find the correct flag option*.
- Run the challenge with the found option
  *After you read the manpage, run*:
```bash
/challenge/challenge --whatever-option-you-found
```
