### summary 
Imagine you want to build a new folder (box) called `pwn`, and inside it, you want to put a **blank paper** called `college`.

In Linux:

- To **make a new folder**, you say:<br>
  ðŸ‘‰ `mkdir` (which means make directory)

- To **make a file**, you say:<br>
  ðŸ‘‰ `touch` (just like before)
___________
### solution 
- Create the `pwn` directory:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/pwn
```
- Create the `college` file inside that directory:
```bash
touch /tmp/pwn/college
```
- Run the challenge checker:
```bash
/challenge/run
```
