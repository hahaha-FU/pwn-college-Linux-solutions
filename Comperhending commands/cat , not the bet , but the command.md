### summary 
Imagine there's a tiny book (called `flag`) sitting in your room (your home directory — the place your terminal starts in).
Your job is to open it and read what's inside.

To do that, we use a command called `cat`.
The `cat` command means “show me what’s inside this file.”

So if you have a file named `story.txt`, you can type:
```bash
cat story.txt
```
And it will print the contents of that file.
__________
### solution 
- Open your terminal. You should already be in your home directory.
- Type ls to list the files:
```bash
ls
```
- You’ll see a file named flag.
- Use cat to read the file:
```bash
cat flag
```
