###  Summary

This challenge introduces you to shell command history. The shell (like Bash) remembers all the commands you previously typed. You can press the Up arrow key (↑) to scroll back through your old commands, and the Down arrow key (↓) to move forward through them.

In this challenge, the flag is already stored in your history, so you don’t need to type any command — just use the arrow keys!

*Hint* :<br>
Press the ↑ (up arrow) key repeatedly in the terminal until you see a command that looks like a flag

### solution
- Open the terminal.
- use the **history** command to see your full history
- Press the Up arrow key (↑)  and the Down arrow key (↓) , until you find a command like:
```bash 
 the flag is pwn.college{your_flag_here}
```
