###  Summary

This challenge introduces you to shell command history. The shell (like Bash) remembers all the commands you previously typed. You can press the Up arrow key (↑) to scroll back through your old commands, and the Down arrow key (↓) to move forward through them.

In this challenge, the flag is already stored in your history, so you don’t need to type any command — just use the arrow keys!
