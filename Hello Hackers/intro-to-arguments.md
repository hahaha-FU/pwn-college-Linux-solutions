###  Summary

This challenge introduces you to the concept of **commands with arguments** in Linux.  
When you type a command into the terminal and press Enter, the shell (the command-line interface) parses your input:

- The **first word** is the **command**
- The **rest of the words** are called **arguments**, which are extra data passed to the command

####  Example 1: One argument

```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello
Hello
Explanation:
```
In this example :
- **echo** is the command
- **hello** is the argument
- The output is simply the word **hello** printed to the terminal
