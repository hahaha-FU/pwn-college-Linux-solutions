##  Summary

In this  challenge, you're introduced to how Linux commands work. You type a command, press Enter, and the shell runs it. For example, `whoami` returns your username. The goal here is to simply run the `hello` command to receive the flag.

‚ö†Ô∏è Commands are **case-sensitive**, so make sure to type `hello` exactly ‚Äî not `HELLO` or any other variation.
