# Linux Luminarium â€“ pwn.college Challenges
This repository contains my solutions to the [Linux Luminarium](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium) challenge set from pwn.college.
The Linux Luminarium is a series of hands-on exercises designed to teach essential Linux skills, including command-line usage, file manipulation, scripting, permissions, and more.

This repo serves both as a record of my progress and a reference for others learning Linux fundamentals through practical challenges. Each solution is organized by challenge name, with relevant commands, notes, and explanations when necessary.
