### summary 
Using `*` to match filenames is powerful, but also dangerous â€” especially with commands like `rm`.<br> One wrong match, and... goodbye files! ðŸ˜±

Thatâ€™s why tab completion is a safer and smarter choice when targeting specific files
- **In this challenge**:

- There's a file in /challenge/ that holds the flag.
- You can see it using ls, butâ€¦
- You canâ€™t type its name manually â€” it's got some sneaky characters or formatting!
- You must use tab completion to auto-complete the filename.

### solution 
```bash
cat /challenge/pwn[TAB]
```
**ðŸ‘‰ Hit the `Tab` key after typing `pwn` and let Bash complete the filename for you.**
