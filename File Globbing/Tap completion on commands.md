### summary 
- So far, you've used tab completion to help you complete file names. But tab completion can do more than that — it can also auto-complete commands!

- This is very helpful when you're trying to run a command but don’t want to type the whole thing manually — especially when the command has a long or strange name
- There is a command (not a file) that starts with the word:
```bash
pwncollege 
```
- This command will print the flag when run.
- But you’re not supposed to type the full name — instead, you must use tab completion to auto-complete it.

### solution 
- In your terminal, just type:
```bash
pwncollege<TAB>
```
