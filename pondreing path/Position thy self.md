###  Summary:

This challenge teaches you how to navigate the Linux filesystem using the cd (change directory) command.
Each process, including your terminal shell, operates from a current working directory. You can switch between directories using:
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```
### Solution : 
- Letâ€™s say the challenge told you to change to `/tmp`. You would:
 ```bash
  cd /tmp
  /challenge/run
 ```
 - If it told you to go to `/home/hacker`, then you would:

```bash
cd /home/hacker
/challenge/run
```
### In Summary:
- Use `cd` to change to the required directory.

- Then run the `/challenge/run` program from there, using its absolute path.
