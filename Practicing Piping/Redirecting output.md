### summary 
Imagine you have a magic talking box (that’s your computer 💻). You can tell it to say something, and instead of talking out loud, it can write it on paper 📝.

You tell it:
✨ "Say `hi` and write it on a paper called `asdf`!"
And the way to say that in computer talk is:
```bash
echo hi > asdf
```
- `echo` hi → means: “Say hi!”

- `>` → means: “Don’t say it out loud, write it on paper instead!”

- `asdf` → that’s the name of the paper 🧾.
