### Summary
Youâ€™re connecting two commands together:
 `/challenge/pwn` â†’ `/challenge/college`

But what if something goes wrong and you donâ€™t see the data?<br>
You want to peek at whatâ€™s flowing between them. <br>

Thatâ€™s where `tee` comes in!<br>
**It copies the data so you can see it AND pass it along.**
__________
### Solution
`/challenge/pwn | tee seen.txt | /challenge/college`
__________
- `tee` makes a copy of the data into a file (like a T-pipe ðŸ’§).
- You can read `seen.txt` to debug what's flowing between commands.
